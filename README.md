## ❗️ Important Notes

- **No zero division protection:** The script assumes the second number is not zero when dividing. Be cautious!
- **No error handling:** For simplicity, there are no checks for non-numeric inputs.
- **Decimals are welcome:** Thanks to `float()`, both whole numbers and decimals work great.

## 🤹‍♂️ Why Try This?

- **Learn the basics of user input and arithmetic in Python.**
- **Customize it:** Add more operations, improve the user interface, or beef up the error handling.
- **Have fun while coding!** Because who says math has to be boring? 😎
